# Installation and use <a name='installation-and-use'></a>
**Before starting, it is very important to mention that you need to have Node js installed**.
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
The first is used to install certain dependencies, and the second is used to compile the program.
If everything went well, a window with the web page should open in your browser.
 
# Licence <a name='licence'></a>
The project presented has an MIT license.
